E2k Mapping Table Update:
The DFIN team will provide the FINGPA team with an updated E2k mapping table.
The provided table will contain only two columns.
We need clarity on the preferred approach for updating the existing data:
Truncate and Load: Should we truncate the existing table and load the new data entirely?
Row-Level Update: Alternatively, should we only add or update specific rows based on the new data?
