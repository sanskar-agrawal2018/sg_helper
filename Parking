Title: Smart Parking Management System for Organizations
Problem Statement: Managing parking spaces in organizations can be chaotic, inefficient, and frustrating for employees. Traditional methods often lead to conflicts over spots, underutilization of available space, and difficulties in reallocating spots based on changing needs. This inefficiency can cause delays, stress, and a negative impact on overall productivity.

Problem Solved: The Smart Parking Management System leverages AI and IoT to automate the allocation and reallocation of parking spaces. By using sensors to monitor occupancy and an AI algorithm to dynamically assign spots based on user needs and availability, this system ensures optimal use of space. Employees receive real-time updates on their allocated spot through a mobile app, which also provides directions to the parking location.

Benefits:

Efficiency: Reduces time spent searching for parking spots and minimizes delays.

Fairness: Ensures equitable distribution of parking spaces based on need and availability.

Real-time Updates: Provides up-to-date information on spot availability and directions.

Improved Employee Satisfaction: Reduces stress and frustration, leading to a better work environment.

Optimal Space Utilization: Maximizes the use of available parking, preventing under or overutilization.
