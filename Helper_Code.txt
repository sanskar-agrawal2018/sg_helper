Problem Statement: AI-Powered Document Query System

In today's data-driven world, organizations deal with massive amounts of unstructured data, such as reports, contracts, research papers, and other documents. Extracting relevant information from this data is often a slow, manual process, leading to inefficiency and errors. We need an AI-powered solution that can automate this process and transform the way we interact with large document sets.

Challenge:

Build an intelligent document query system that leverages AI to allow users to upload large documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.) and query them in natural language. The system should be capable of understanding the context and semantics of the documents and provide accurate, relevant responses to user queries. The goal is to create a tool that enables easy, fast, and accurate information retrieval from complex documents.

Key Features:

1. Document Ingestion: The system should support uploading various document formats (PDF, Word, etc.) and efficiently process them.


2. Natural Language Query: Users should be able to query the system in natural language to find relevant information within the document.


3. Contextual Understanding: The AI model should understand the context of the document and the userâ€™s query, going beyond keyword matching.


4. Accurate and Relevant Responses: The system should provide precise responses or pointers to specific sections of the document based on the query.


5. Multi-Document Support: The system should be capable of querying across multiple documents to provide consolidated answers.



Evaluation Criteria:

Accuracy and relevance of query responses.

Performance and scalability in handling large or multiple documents.

User experience, including ease of use and response time.

Innovation in leveraging AI for document understanding and information retrieval.


Participants are encouraged to explore techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval to build a robust and intelligent system.
